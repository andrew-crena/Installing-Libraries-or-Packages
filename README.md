# Installing-Libraries-or-Packages
Due to the simplicity of this task, this repository should not be lengthy, but will serve as a reference for future use in case I need to sharpen some skills that improve my ability to find/learn/use new libraries or packages (tidyverse or ggplot2, for example). After all, it's what makes RStudio so fun!!!!!
